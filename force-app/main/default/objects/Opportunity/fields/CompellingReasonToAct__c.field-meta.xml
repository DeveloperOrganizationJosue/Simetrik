    <description>A compelling reason to act (CRTA) is an occurrence where, if the customer doesn’t make a decision, significant consequences will follow. If we can identify a compelling reason to act, we can also present the implications of not making a decision by that date. The CRTA is a potentially very powerful motivator for buyers to move forward with a purchase decision, and the seller who best understands and articulates the CRTA is usually the one who wins.</description>
